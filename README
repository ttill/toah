toaH - not even a tiny cms

What is toaH?
  toaH connects HTML pages and adds templates to them. You write your HTML pages just as you
  normally would and toah is either not mentioned in the file at all and accessed with the help of
  a rewrite engine or is included with a single line of PHP. toaH integrates the template into the body
  of the page and adds stylesheets. Now toaH searches for a file which contains a link list with
  all files that should appear in the menu.

  * You have full control of what you are doing.
  * It's easy to integrate into existing pages.
  * It doesn't get in your way.
  * It prevents you from doing the same things over and over again for every page added.

Setting up toaH
  Warning: This information is partly outdated and not valid anymore Check the provided examples.

  The HTML
    It is recommended that your HTML is valid to guarantee the parser to work well.
    toaH offers two ways to be used:

      Parameter
	Give the name of your file + the absolute path from the webserver root to toah.php?file=…
	This will result in ugly URLs and you will have to change your links. To avoid this it is
	recommended to use a rewrite engine. A sample .htaccess for Apache is included in the sources. 
      Include
	Add a line similar to this one at the very top of your file to include toah.php:
	<?php include_once "path/to/toah.php"; ?> Make sure to use include_once or require_once.
	A simple include will not work! 

  The Menu
    General
      * The menu file is called menu.txt
      * toaH uses the files in the parent directories to create a path
      * CSV is used
      * Semicolons are used as separators

    Structure
      * In the first line the title takes place. It is used in the path and as the main title on
	every page in the area of validity of this menu.
      * The link list consists of three items:
	  1. path to the file (without leading slash)
	  2. name of the link
	  3. sub-title which will be used on the linked page only

      * Example:
	  Doku
          changelog.php;Changelog;Change log
          howto/index.php;How To;HowTo Page
          faq/index.php;FAQ;Frequently Asked Questions 

    Special Chars
      * To use a semicolon put quotation marks around it:
        Example: faq/index.php;"FAQ;other stuff";Frequently Asked Questions
      * To write special chars use HTML Entities:
        Example: faq/index.php;"FAQ &amp; &hearts;";FAQ

  The Template
    * The template is called template.xml and has to be in the same directory as toah.php
    * Everything that should be used by toaH has to be in the first div in the file
	IDs that are required: thMenu, thPath, thContent
	Optional IDs: thMainTitle, thPageTitle, thAuthor, thChange
    * thPath and thMenu have to contain an element used to wrap the items (see example)
    * to separate your path entries add a second child to thPath like this
      <li class="thSeparator">/<li> (for another example take a look at the template Example below)
    * Everything that is in the body of the HTML file will be put into the element with the ID thContent.
    * Example:
<div>
  <div>
    <h1 id="thMainTitle"></h1>
    <h2 id="thPageTitle"></h2>
    Path:
    <p id="thPath"><span/><span>»</span></p>
    <ul id="thMenu"><li/></ul>
    <p>Author: <span id="thAuthor"></span><br />Last Change: <span id="thChange"></span></p>
  </div>
  <div id="thContent"></div>
</div>
<p>Some stuff that will not be in the output generated by toaH</p>


  The Stylesheet
    * The stylesheet is called style.css
    * toaH will use all stylesheets found in parent directories. This will enable you to add something without copying everything.
