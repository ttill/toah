v141004 (2014/10/04)
  * Some small code cleanups

v140928 (2014/09/28)
  * Add sub-menu functionality

v130129 (2013/01/29)
  * Add option to prevent direct acccess of toah.php

v130125 (2013/01/25)
  * Try to make sure the file to handle is inside the webroot directory

v130108 (2013/01/08)
  * Send content type headers earlier to avoid problems when a plugins outputs something directly
  * Add a simple log functionality to toaH (not printed/handled by toaH itself)
  * Include a plugin file (toah/thplugins.php) in the archive containing the following plugins: getInfo - moved from toah.php, noToah - allows to disable toah by passing a parameter, counter - a very simple stat counter, debugToah - outputs the log and some other data

v121231 (2012/12/31)
  * Provide proper content type for XHTML documents (fixes some tag closing issues)

v121230 (2012/12/30)
  * Enhance API
  * Updated htaccess to pass on the query string

v121216 (2012/12/16)
  * Remove dependencies between path, menu and titles as read from "menu.txt" files; Each of them should now work independently even if a wrapper item for another one is missing in the template
  * Some small code cleanups

v120719
  * fixed: When in webroot wrong link was used
  * Important: Remove encoding detection and conversion between different ones since it was very buggy and caused a lot of limits. Now every file used by toaH has to be utf-8 encoded!

v120620
  * fixed: Fallback to HTML parsing not working
  * When ASCII encoding is detected by PHP for the document prefer UTF-8 instead
  * Don't hide errors/warnings by default but rely on the server settings

v120530
  * Stop using $_SERVER["DOCUMENT_ROOT"] since its availability is not guaranteed. This requires an additional parameter when toaH is used through mod_rewrite or in a similar way: link should contain the filename of the page to parse, relative to the document root (see sample.htaccess).
  * When using toaH by including it, remove the necessity to call toahEnd() at the end of input. toaH needs to be included with include_once/require_once. include or require will fail!
  * Enhance module flexibility by introducing new stages, accessible through constants. The documentation for the module API is also improved. Modules need an update to the new stages!
  * When the template file does not exist do not fallback to an internal one, but run without it.

v120523
  * smaller code cleanups
  * -1 file access

v120103
  * changed: meaning of file parameter. It should now contain the absolute, full path.
  * fixed: duplication of the xmlns attribute of the html tag when using the XHTML 1.0 Doctype
  * distinguish between HTML and XHTML when loading and saving the XML DOM to gain better support for HTML
  * sample.htaccess (in archives) simplified

v120102
  * fixed: loading of thplugins.php when toah used via include
  * cleaner code structure (separation of menu and stylesheet modules from toaH core class)
  * remove T::$file and T::$link. If toaH is used via parameter $_SERVER["SCRIPT_FILENAME"] and $_SERVER["PHP_SELF"] will now be set to the input file to not require distinguishment between usage via include and parameter anymore.

v111230
  * fixed: last element in body was being dropped (in most cases just whitespace)

v111229
  * fixed: links in menu did not work in webroot due to double slash

v111222
  * fixed: make usage via include work again

v100330
  * change Backend: Simple HTML Dom -> DOM + DomXPath
  * use static class instead of global array to store data
  * allow more possibilities for plugins / modules
  * Speed boost (up to twice as fast as previous versions of toaH v2)

v100214
  * cleaner links: links used in the menu, for including stylesheets, ... are now relative to the webroot. (till now they might have looked something like this: ./../../../../index.php)
  * removed check if linked file (menu) exists as this may lead to problems when using a rewrite engine
  * some smaller clean-ups

v100119
  * new: load possible plugins from thplugins.php (same directory as toah.php) (no plugins included yet) (documentation on how to write plugins to follow)

v100111
  * fixed: do not quit script if warning was created somewhere before toah execution
  * fixed: try to work around if enviroment variable DOCUMENT_ROOT is not set

v100110
  * new: add support to open file via parameter (for details see the html)
  * fixed: output buffer + callback doesn't work on some servers -> use output buffer without callback (for details see the html)

v091128
  * fixed: correct order of stylesheets: current one is last to make it override parent ones
  * fixed: support different encodings: toaH detects the encoding from the HTML File and encodes everything from different files (menu, template) accordingly

v091126
  * fixed: Now the links to parent elements in the path refers to a directory rather than to "directory/index.php". This allows the user to use a directory index different to "index.php".

v091124
  * new: Added support for separators between Path element (e.g. "Parent Child" now might look "Parent / Child"). To use the separator add a second child to #thPath similar to this one: <li>/</li>
